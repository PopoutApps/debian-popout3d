    long_description="Take a set of photos of a subject and the software will create a 3D image from each pair of photos in the set, so that you can choose the best. Vertical and rotational alignment of the left and right images is essential for a convincing 3D effect, but difficult to achieve with an ordinary camera. The software corrects any misalignment. Formats available are anaglyph (red/cyan), side-by-side and crossover. Several sets of photos can be processed at once, they can be previewed and poor ones can be deleted.",
